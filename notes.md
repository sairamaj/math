## Law of Sine rule
* The Law of Sines (sine rule) is an important rule relating the sides and angles of any triangle (it doesn't have to be right-angled!):

![Triangle](https://github.com/sairamaj/math/blob/master/images/signruletriangle.gif)

sinA =  sinB  = sinC
____    ____    ____
a         b       c

## The Cosine Rule

This also works in any triangle:

![Triangle](https://github.com/sairamaj/math/blob/master/images/cosineruletriangle.png)

c² = a² + b² - 2abcosC
which can also be written as:   
a² = b² + c² - 2bccosA

__Note:__ given two side lengths and the angle measure between them, we can use the law of cosines.

## 30,60,90
![30,60,90](https://github.com/sairamaj/math/blob/master/images/30-60aa.gif)
cos30 = √3/2  sin30 = 1/2
cos60 = 1/2   sin60 = √3/2

## 45,45,90
cos30 = √3/2  sin30 = 1/2
sin45 = 1/√2  cos45 = 1/√2

## Degrees to redians
* 360 = 2π  
* 1π = 180

## Pythogorean Identity
* cos​²(θ)+sin​²(θ)=1  

### Cartesian Coordinates
* Location in x,y 

### Polar Coordinates
* Point in a space is an angle of rotation around the origin and radius from the origin.
* The magnitude(length) and direction(angle) of a vector
* (r,θ)

Trigonometry is used to convert between Cartesian and Polar coordinates

y = r sin(θ)
x = r cos(θ)

### Angle of elevation
When you see an object above you, there is an __angle of elevation__ between the horizontal and your line of sight of the object.

### Angle of depression
When you see object below you, there is an __angle of depression__ between the horizontal and your l ine of the sight of the object.
