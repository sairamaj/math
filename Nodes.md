## Law of Sine rule
* The Law of Sines (sine rule) is an important rule relating the sides and angles of any triangle (it doesn't have to be right-angled!):

sinA =  sinB  = sinC
____    ____    ____
a         b       c

## The Cosine Rule

This also works in any triangle:

c² = a² + b² - 2abcosC
which can also be written as:
a² = b² + c² - 2bccosA
